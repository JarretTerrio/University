An app designed around the intake and control of certain known vices.

 Users can use the app as a journal to record personal intake amounts & times for better health management. They can see their usage on a daily, weekly, and
 monthly scale, and are notified when certain drugs are incompatible to take with one another, or when an unsafe amount of a drug is consumed.
