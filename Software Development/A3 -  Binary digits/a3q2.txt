a) The string 2ndday is not a legal identifier in C because you cannot 
begin a name with a number as C was not built to handle it. To fix this error,
we could just use the word "Second" instead.

b) To combine the two of these printf commands into one is actually very 
easy. All we need to do is combine the two of them together and use the 
/n character to drop a new line. The new command would look like this

printf("All that is gold does not glitter,\n
  Not all those who wander are lost\n");
