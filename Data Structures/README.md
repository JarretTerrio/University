# Summary

Welcome to CSCI 2110 - Computer Science III, a core course in your second year CS curriculum. The course focuses on two important concepts in Computer Science, namely, Data Structures and Algorithms. We will study, design, implement and analyze a number of data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, AVL trees, heaps, hash tables, maps, sets, and graphs. Algorithms on data structures will include a variety of searching, sorting and graph algorithms. Complexity of algorithms will also be discussed and analyzed. The implementation will be done using an object-oriented approach.
